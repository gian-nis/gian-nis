## Who I am ðŸ‘‹

Soon to graduate with a Computer Science degree and then specializing in cybersecurity ðŸ“š 

Pursuing CS was not always a clear plan for me growing up, but my availaibility to tech and liking to mathmetics lead me to start the journey. While continuing on my studies, I was open and curious to many fields and even dabled in some. As I went through the years, I found genguine interest in coding, but even more interest of the field of cybersecurity. My first step was taking the cybersecurity certificate that Google offers. I felt that it was a good basic understanding to what goes on in the field. I then ended up passing Core 1 of the A+ CompTIA certificate, and have a goal of taking Core 2 by the end of 2024. From there I plan on collaborting with others to take the CCNA. In regards to coding, I finished a project that manages and secures passwords in python. More of that can be seen more in my repository section.

### What I see myself doing in the future ðŸ’¡

I've looked into what cybersecurity can split off into and so far, I feel pretty open to any field. Networking, security intelligence, and/or systems engineering are all things that I would attempt. I'm sure that as I continue learning, I will steer into a specific direction.
